# Context-Aware Language Modeling Engine (RNN/GRU)

- Developed a character-level text generation model using TensorFlow and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict sequence probabilities.

- Implemented custom text vectorization and temperature-based sampling to control the creativity and coherence of generated outputs.
